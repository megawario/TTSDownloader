# TTSDownloader
Downloader for Tabletop Simulator mods.

The aim was to create a simple app to be able to create a zip file for the mods on TTS.
Taken into account that somefiles are hosted in shady places, this way will fetch the resources.

Check out TTS out there:

# Usage

1. You can run the jar on the target folder.
2. Select the Workshop or json file
3. give a name for the game
4. select dump folder
5. pick zip if required or dry run (will not download anything)
6. check if file was created

To install the mod, just copy the Mod folder and subfolders to the mod location on your machine.
The cache on TTS will handle the rest.
